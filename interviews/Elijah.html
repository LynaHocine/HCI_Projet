    <h1>Interview – Elijah</h1>

    <h2>How many demonstrations have you attended this year?</h2>
    <p>More than 10</p>

    <h2>Why do you protest?</h2>
    <p>
      I protest to make sure my voice is heard and to be able to express my opinions to the government.
      As a sociology student, I want to better understand society and actively take part in social change.
      Because I want to change things in the world that I do not agree with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protesting reflects my personal values and morals, and allows me to support causes even when they do not directly affect me or the people involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I protest to try to make a difference and to create a sense of connection with others.
      Demonstrations allow me to meet people who share the same values, and I learn a lot through participating in them.
    </p>

    <h2>Have you ever organized a demonstration?</h2>
    <p>
      I have never organized a demonstration myself because I did not have time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the demonstrations I attended were organized by other people, often by friends.
    </p>

    <h2>What problems did you encounter?</h2>
    <p>
      The problems depend on the country I am in. For example, when I was in Singapore, protest permits were very strict, which meant I could not attend any demonstrations there.
      In the Netherlands, I have the right to protest freely, at any time, unless the protest is shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, I received the invitation to a protest only 30 minutes before it started.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you spread the information?</h2>
    <p>
      Information is mainly shared through social media, such as WhatsApp and Signal. It is also spread a lot by word of mouth, by talking directly with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often receive information about demonstrations through messages from friends.
    </p>

    <h2>What problems have you encountered as a participant?</h2>
    <p>
      When I arrive and there are already people there, it is very helpful because someone is already organizing things.
      But when there are not many people, it can be difficult to find the exact location of the protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the specific location is not shared in advance because it could be dangerous for the organizers and the participants, especially when protesting against the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining a protest, I always think about how long I expect to stay and how long I realistically can stay.
      Because I was not a citizen of the country where I was protesting, I felt a constant sense of fear during demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember being one time in a protest only a few people behind the police, linking arms, when the police threatened to charge.
      In situations like this, organizers need to inform protesters about potential dangers, either through social media or even with printed information, so people know what to do in different scenarios.
      I often have fears such as: “Am I going to get arrested?” or “Am I going to be deported?” whenever I protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication during a protest can become very difficult once it reaches a certain level. Messages cannot always be shared with everyone, except through megaphones but it's not as easy because not everyone can hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another challenge is the physical aspect, I know that when protests last a long time, some people may have low energy or low blood sugar, so it is important to bring snacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also some people do not want to be seen or identified, which can also be a struggle during demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If people have already arrived, we can contact them directly to share the exact location, or inform people we trust through group chats.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you protect yourself during a demonstration?</h2>
    <p>
      I make sure to stay well hydrated, because protests involve a lot of walking, chanting, and sweating. I personally also carry a flashlight with me, just in case it is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I usually wear comfortable clothes that do not stand out too much. Because some of my friends were chased by the police because their outfits were recognizable, so I try not to attract unnecessary attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also make sure to know my rights, because if I get arrested, it is important to be able to protect myself legally. Because for example sometimes, people are put into police vans and dropped on the other side of the city, so being prepared for that possibility is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I see that a situation is escalating, I try to move away from it, especially because I know I could be deported since I am not a citizen. So I always think about my exit strategy before and during the protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people share QR codes that can be scanned to fill out a form guaranteeing access to a lawyer if someone is arrested, which is very reassuring.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it easy to help people during a protest?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, it feels easy to help people because there is a strong sense of unity among participants.
      I remember one protest where someone needed an ambulance, and everyone immediately moved to make space so the ambulance could reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never been to a protest that was extremely intense, which made it easier to help others when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If something happens to you, there are almost always people around who are ready to help. It feels similar to the atmosphere at a concert, where people look out for each other when someone needs assistance.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you go home after a protest?</h2>
    <p>
      I use a buddy system and usually stay with friends. Most of the time we leave our bikes in a place where we know they will not be stolen, so we can go home safely and know where to find each other if we get separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always make sure I have someone to walk home with, so I'm not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      People usually make sure to have someone to go home with. I remember one time when I did this for someone else: we were both alone, so we walked together towards the metro.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most of the protests I have attended, train services are usually shut down during the demonstration, but they often resume about 30 minutes later.
