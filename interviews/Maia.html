    <h1>Interview – M</h1>

    Paris, France and Northampton, MA, USA</p>

    <h2>How many protests have you been to this year?</h2>
    <p>
      In 2025, I went to about four protests.
      While studying abroad, I attended a protest in Copenhagen at the parliament,
      demanding that Denmark recognize Palestine as a state.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Smith College, I went to a No Kings Day protest at the beginning of the Trump administration.
      I don’t remember exactly what had just happened politically,
      but it was during a period when Trump was doing a lot of extreme things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also attended events organized by Smith Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP),
      demonstrating for the college to divest from weapons manufacturers.
      I went to a couple of those last year.
    </p>

    <h2>Have you ever organized a protest?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, I organized a rally in high school.
      It was a sexual assault awareness rally.
    </p>

    <h2>How did that go? Did you face any problems?</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the problems I encountered were administrative.
      Because I was in high school, I had to deal with the school administration
      and their rules about what students were allowed to organize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another major challenge was spreading awareness about the rally
      and getting people to attend.
      The turnout was not very big — around one hundred people.
    </p>

    <h2>How did you spread the word?</h2>
    <p>
      Since it was high school, social media played a big role,
      especially Snapchat at the time.
      People would post on their Snapchat stories encouraging others
      to come and bring their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Word of mouth was also very important.
    </p>

    <h2>From the point of view of a participant, how do you usually find information about protests?</h2>
    <p>
      Almost all the information I get comes from social media or word of mouth.
      Sometimes my friends or even my mom will text me about a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is something like a No Kings Day protest,
      it will usually appear on Instagram.
      I follow accounts that post about these events,
      and I interact with that content enough that the algorithm shows it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On campus, it is mostly word of mouth.
      When I was in Copenhagen, I found information mainly through Instagram.
    </p>

    <h2>When do you decide to go to a protest? Is it always simple for you?</h2>
    <p>
      It mostly depends on my schedule and what I have time for.
      I try to attend something every couple of months,
      depending on how important I feel the issue is.
    </p>
    <p>
      If something particularly bad happens in the news,
      I feel more motivated to go.
      Since I study government, I am usually well informed about current events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other factors include whether the protest is close by,
      at a convenient time, and whether I can go with someone.
      I am much less likely to go if I have to go alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common reasons for not going are having class,
      the protest being at an inconvenient time,
      not having people to go with,
      or not having transportation.
      I strongly believe in having a buddy system.
    </p>

    <h2>Do you usually find people beforehand to go together?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, I have only been to protests with other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I realize I have attended many political events.
      For example, the Dyke March in New York City could definitely be considered a protest,
      even if I did not think of it that way at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      While visiting a friend in Washington D.C. this summer,
      we decided to attend a protest outside the White House.
      We stayed for about an hour or an hour and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was probably the most high-profile protest I have attended,
      with reporters, press interviews, the National Guard,
      and a strong police presence.
    </p>

    <h2>How did you feel going to that protest in Washington D.C.?</h2>
    <p>
      Everything feels very uncertain in the U.S. right now,
      and it is often unclear what is dangerous and what is not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were unsure whether it was safer to wear a mask or not,
      to talk to the press or not,
      or to allow ourselves to be photographed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we are both white women,
      we are aware that we have a certain amount of privilege.
      We felt that putting ourselves in visible positions,
      such as in front of cameras or between police and more vulnerable groups,
      was a way to use that privilege responsibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, we were nervous,
      since neither of us lives in D.C. and we are both only twenty years old.
    </p>

    <h2>Can you explain the “buddy system” you mentioned?</h2>
    <p>
      The buddy system means staying within sight of the people you come with.
      I usually stay with my friends for the entire protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protests I have attended have been relatively small
      and not violent, so I have never been in direct danger.
      However, if something were to escalate,
      knowing where the people you came with are is essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also try to be aware of whether there are people nearby
      with medical supplies or water,
      especially in case of injuries, heat, or tear gas.
    </p>

    <h2>During a protest, when do you feel most involved?</h2>
    <p>
      It depends on the type of protest.
      During sit-ins, simply being present and taking up space
      makes you feel involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      During marches, chanting, yelling, or holding a sign
      makes me feel more actively part of the group.
    </p>

    <h2>How would you describe interactions with other protesters?</h2>
    <p>
      Interactions are usually friendly.
      Everyone is there for the same cause,
      so people are generally open, supportive,
      and willing to engage with each other.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you protect yourself when protesting?</h2>
    <p>
      At one point, there was concern that participating in SJP protests
      could affect students’ financial aid.
      This made me more cautious about attending highly disruptive protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do attend something like that,
      I am more likely to wear a mask
      so that I am not easily identifiable in photos.
    </p>

    <h2>Is there anything that could make you feel safer during protests?</h2>
    <p>
      My sense of safety depends a lot on the political context of the location.
      For example, I felt much more unsafe in Washington D.C.
      than in Northampton or Copenhagen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Denmark, strong free speech protections
      made me feel very safe during protests.
      In the U.S., the situation feels more unpredictable,
      especially with federal forces involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think having more people trained in emergency situations,
      such as responding to injuries, gun violence, or tear gas,
      would make me feel safer.
      Being surrounded by experienced people is reassuring.
    </p>

    <h2>What do you usually do after a protest?</h2>
    <p>
      After a protest, I usually just go home.
      The only thing I might do is check when the next demonstration is happening.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you feel after protests?</h2>
    <p>
      I usually feel proud of myself
      for devoting the time and energy to a cause I care about.
